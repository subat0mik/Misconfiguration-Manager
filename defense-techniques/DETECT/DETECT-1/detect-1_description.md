# DETECT-1

## Description
Monitor site server domain computer accounts authenticating from another source

## Summary
An attacker may use coercion methods to force the the SCCM site server's domain computer account to authenticate to an attacker-controlled machine and relay that authentication to another target. This elevation method enables privilege escalation and lateral movement if the attacker targets any other SCCM site system, as the site server requires local administrator privileges on other site systems.

A defender can compare the `Account Name` field of [Event ID: 4624](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624) to that of the `Source_Host` field, or the static IP address of the site server to the `Source Network Address` field. If the site server's domain computer account generates a successful logon event from a source that is not that site server, an NTLM relay attack may have taken place.

The example below displays a successful logon event for the SCCM site server from a host that is not the site server.

```
    Source_Host: server2.sccmlab.local
    An account was successfully logged on.
